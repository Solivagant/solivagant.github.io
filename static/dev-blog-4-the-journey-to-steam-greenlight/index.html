<p>Gunkatana is my game in development, a celebration of style and bloodshed. "Easy to learn, hard to master" <strong>zero-sum combat</strong> with laser guns, swords, and our unique <em>TURBO-RAILS</em>, an ultraviolent take on skateboard <strong>grinding</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="theteam">THE TEAM</h1>

<p>So, now that you know what <strong>Gunkatana</strong> is, who the hell is making it?</p>

<p>Me? I'm <strong>Geraldo</strong>, a game programmer from Portugal. I moved to the UK almost 4 years ago to follow my passion for these things we call video games, and in 2014 I created a prototype that eventually became <strong>Gunkatana</strong>.</p>

<p>For this game, I'm inspired by movies like <strong>The Matrix</strong> and <strong>Kill Bill</strong> and by games like <strong>Hotline Miami</strong>, <strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> and <strong>Towerfall</strong>. I relish on satisfying combat mechanics, the <em>weighty feel</em> of attacks and movements, and putting that into the game <em>has been a joy</em>.</p>

<p>The most difficult part for me, but perhaps the most satisfying as well, is the disconnect between what I want to add to the game, and how well what's in my mind translates into the finished project. </p>

<p>Toying around prototyping new combat and movement mechanics is something that really satisfies me, probably more so than adding "content".</p>

<p>The second most difficult part comes from my career development, as I spent most of my time as a software engineer, solving problems, developing an incredibly useful array of skills for game making. But that came at the cost of not developing my creativity, at least in terms of making things and putting them out there for everyone to see (any software engineer / programmer will tell you that it requires a LOT of creativity, and I don't deny it!).</p>

<p>So sometimes I struggle with going on with the project, considering if what I am doing is really worth doing at all, if it is worth bothering other people with. I'm sure everyone feels this as well, at a certain amount.</p>

<p>That said, here we are, Gunkatana is on Steam Greenlight waiting for your votes, we've got a fantastic trailer (with the help of Miriam Ghromann) and our first playable build is out for people to check it out from the comfort of their homes.</p>

<p>Initially a project solely by me and <strong>CrazyArcadia</strong>, we've since expanded the team: </p>

<p><strong>Sarah Schemske</strong> is the project's writer, and she's fleshing out the personalities of our playable characters and the dystopian world where the game is set; </p>

<p><strong>João Nascimento</strong> is our producer, which means he makes sure everything is on track, helps us get the game out into the open, and motivates us (it's no wonder we've nicknamed him <strong><em>The Wrath</em></strong>);</p>

<p><strong>Marco Machado</strong>, artist, is creating something beautiful that we will be revealing in the coming weeks;</p>

<p><strong>Joonas Turner</strong> and <strong>Niilo Takalainen</strong>, the sound designers behind Broforce, are crafting every katana slash and laser shot spark, and have also given us the first voice of Gunkatana in the form of our sarcastic in-game announcer;</p>

<p><strong>Electric Cafe</strong>, the people behind Aqua Kitty and Rock Boshers retro soundtracks, are creating a retrowave soundtrack for the game, that you can already hear in our playable demo and in available samples at their Soundcloud.</p>

<p>I wouldn't be here, working full time on this project, if it wasn't for them, and other friends who have helped us get it this far.</p>
